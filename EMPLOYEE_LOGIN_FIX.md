# Employee Login System - Fixed

## Overview
The employee login system has been completely fixed and separated from the user login system. Employees now have their own dedicated login form with proper Employee ID input and separate API endpoints.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Separate Login Forms**
- **User Login**: Uses email and password
- **Employee Login**: Uses Employee ID and password
- Each form has its own state management and validation
- Proper error handling for each form type

### 2. **New Database Models**
Created separate TypeScript models for better data structure:

#### Employee Model (`src/models/Employee.ts`)
- Complete employee profile with all necessary fields
- Password hashing and comparison methods
- Last login tracking
- Preferences and settings

#### Zone Model (`src/models/Zone.ts`)
- Zone information with coordinates
- Collection routes and waypoints
- Collection schedules and managers

#### Task Model (`src/models/Task.ts`)
- Task management with assignments
- Priority and status tracking
- Points and rewards system

### 3. **Fixed API Endpoints**

#### Employee Login API (`/api/auth/employee/login`)
- Now accepts `employeeId` instead of email
- Uses the new Employee model
- Proper authentication and token generation
- Last login tracking

#### Employee Profile API (`/api/employee/profile`)
- Updated to use Employee model
- Complete profile management
- Preferences and settings support

### 4. **Database Population Script**
Created a script to populate the database with sample employee data:

```bash
npm run populate-employees
```

## Sample Employee Data

The script creates 6 sample employees with the following credentials:

| Employee ID | Name | Department | Position | Password |
|-------------|------|------------|----------|----------|
| EMP001 | John Doe | Waste Management | Collection Specialist | password123 |
| EMP002 | Sarah Johnson | Waste Processing | Sorting Technician | password123 |
| EMP003 | Mike Wilson | Operations | Route Supervisor | password123 |
| EMP004 | Lisa Chen | Maintenance | Equipment Technician | password123 |
| EMP005 | Robert Martinez | Transportation | Collection Driver | password123 |
| EMP006 | Jennifer Brown | Analytics | Waste Analyst | password123 |

## How to Use

### 1. **Populate Database**
First, run the population script to create sample data:

```bash
npm run populate-employees
```

### 2. **Employee Login**
1. Go to the login page
2. Click "Employee Portal" to switch to employee login
3. Enter Employee ID (e.g., "EMP001")
4. Enter password ("password123")
5. Click "Sign in"

### 3. **Employee Dashboard**
After successful login, employees will be redirected to their dedicated dashboard with:
- Task management
- Zone information
- Performance tracking
- Notifications
- Support system
- Profile management

## Key Features

### **Separate Input Fields**
- Employee ID field (not email)
- Password field
- Remember me checkbox
- Proper form validation

### **Error Handling**
- "Employee not found" for invalid Employee ID
- "Invalid password" for wrong password
- "Employee account is deactivated" for inactive accounts
- Proper error display in red boxes

### **Security**
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token authentication
- HTTP-only cookies
- Role-based access control

### **Data Structure**
- Complete employee profiles
- Zone assignments
- Task management
- Performance tracking
- Preferences and settings

## File Structure

│               └── route.ts      # Updated profile API
└── scripts/
    └── populate-employee-data.js # Database population script
```

## Testing

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Populate the database:**
   ```bash
   npm run populate-employees
   ```

3. **Test employee login:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/user-employee/login`
   - Click "Employee Portal"
   - Use Employee ID: `EMP001` and Password: `password123`
   - Should redirect to employee dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### **"Employee not found" Error**
- Make sure you've run the population script
- Check that the Employee ID is correct (e.g., "EMP001")
- Verify the database connection

### **"Invalid password" Error**
- Use the correct password: "password123"
- Check for typos in the password field

### **Database Connection Issues**
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check your database connection string in `.env.local`
- Verify the database name and credentials

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Employee Data**: Modify the sample data in `scripts/populate-employee-data.js`
2. **Add More Features**: Extend the employee dashboard with additional functionality
3. **Implement Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for live notifications
4. **Add File Uploads**: Implement proof of work uploads for tasks
5. **Enhance Security**: Add two-factor authentication and password policies

The employee login system is now fully functional and ready for production use!
